# Apprenticeship Learning with Inverse Reinforcement Learning

- This includes a double deep Q implementation (by Daniel. D) and a tabular Q method (by Richard H) of the paper [1] P. Abbeel and A. Y. Ng, “Apprenticeship Learning via Inverse Reinforcement Learning.” using CartPole model from openAI gym.
- [Apprenticeship Learning via Inverse Reinforcement Learning.pdf](Apprenticeship\Learning\via\Inverse\Reinforcement\Learning.pdf) is the presentation slides
- [Apprenticeship_Inverse_Reinforcement_Learning.ipynb](Apprenticeship_Inverse_Reinforcement_Learning.ipynb) is the tabular Q implementation
- [linearq.py](linearq.py) is the deep Q implementation

## Tabular Q Implementation

- [Tabular Q Google Colab Version](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Tmc5fPHP9J0s-vQukLDzRywe47BNni37#scrollTo=bzxZCx5VD3xn)
  - Running the Code: 1. File → playground mode, or Copy to Drive to open a copy 2. shift + enter to run 1 cell. Run all the cells
  - Entire training takes around 10~15min
